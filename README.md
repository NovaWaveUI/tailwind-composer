# Tailwind Composer

Tailwind Composer is a powerful, flexible utility for building complex, multi-slotted, reactive component styles using Tailwind CSS. Designed to integrate seamlessly with React, it leverages twMerge to efficiently handle class merging while offering deep extensibility and customization.

## 🚀 Why Tailwind Composer?

Unlike traditional approaches, Tailwind Composer is designed to:
✔️ Support slot-based designs – perfect for components with multiple elements (e.g., buttons with icons, cards with headers & footers).
✔️ Provide extendable styles – dynamically add new variants without redefining everything.
✔️ Leverage a hierarchical class system – intelligently applies base styles, variants, compound variants, and extensions.
✔️ Ensure type safety – with full TypeScript support, ensuring valid variants and styles.

## 📌 Inspiration

This library is heavily inspired by the amazing work of tailwind-variants. I truly love their approach, and Tailwind Composer was born from my desire to build something similar while exploring different ideas around extendability and customization.

I want to make it clear: tailwind-variants is an incredible library, and I don’t claim to match their level of polish or speed of development. Tailwind Composer is simply my take on a similar concept with a focus on deep customization and slot-based designs.

### Key Differences from Tailwind Variants:

Extending works differently, allowing for more flexibility in modifying existing designs.
No built-in responsive variants (yet) – currently, it focuses on base styles and states.
Designed with a provider-based global customization system in mind.

## 📦 Installation

```sh

## ✨ Usage

### Non-Slotted Components

For single-element components like a button, define base styles, variants, and compound variants.

```tsx
import { createNonSlotVariants } from 'tailwind-composer';

const buttonStyles = createNonSlotVariants({
  base: 'flex items-center justify-center px-4 py-2',
  variants: {
    color: {
      primary: 'bg-blue-500 text-white',
      secondary: 'bg-gray-500 text-white',
    },
    size: {
      sm: 'text-sm px-2',
      md: 'text-md px-3',
      lg: 'text-lg px-4',
    },
  },
  compoundVariants: [
    {
      color: 'primary',
      size: 'lg',
      className: 'shadow-lg',
    },
  ],
  defaultVariants: {
    color: 'primary',
    size: 'md',
  },
});

export function Button({ color, size, children }) {
  return <button className={buttonStyles({ color, size })}>{children}</button>;
}
```

### Slotted Components

For components with multiple elements (e.g., a card with a title, content, and footer), use the slotted API.

```tsx
import { createSlottedVariants } from 'tailwind-composer';

const cardStyles = createSlottedVariants({
  slots: {
    root: 'rounded-lg shadow-md',
    header: 'p-4 border-b',
    title: 'text-lg font-bold',
    content: 'p-4',
    footer: 'p-4 border-t',
  },
  variants: {
    color: {
      primary: {
        root: 'bg-blue-500 text-white',
        title: 'text-blue-200',
      },
      secondary: {
        root: 'bg-gray-500 text-white',
        title: 'text-gray-200',
      },
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    color: 'primary',
  },
});

export function Card({ color, children }) {
  const { root, header, title, content, footer } = cardStyles({ color });

  return (
    <div className={root()}>
      <div className={header()}>
        <h2 className={title()}>Card Title</h2>
      </div>
      <div className={content()}>{children}</div>
      <div className={footer()}>Footer</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🔗 Extending Styles

One of the most powerful features of Tailwind Composer is dynamic extensibility. You can extend existing styles without redefining the entire configuration.

```tsx
const extendedButtonStyles = buttonStyles.extend({
  variants: {
    color: {
      success: 'bg-green-500 text-white',
    },
  },
  compoundVariants: [
    {
      color: 'success',
      className: 'shadow-lg',
    },
  ],
  defaultVariants: {
    color: 'success',
  },
});
```

## 🛠️ Contributing

I built Tailwind Composer because I love UI development and wanted to explore more customizable ways to handle variants and styles in Tailwind. While this project is something I made for myself first, I’d love for others to use and contribute!
