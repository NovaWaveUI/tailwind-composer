# Tailwind Composer

Tailwind Composer is an insipried library for Tailwind CSS that allows you to create multi-slotted complex reactive designs with ease. It is built using twMerge, a utility for merging Tailwind CSS classes, and is designed to be used with React.

## Inspiration

I want to give a huge thanks to the authors of [tailwind-variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/). I love love love their library and I was inspired to create this library after using it. I wanted to create a library that is similar but with a slightly different approach and with some more features. I will note that my work will not be as good as theirs and I will not be able to keep up with their library. I just wanted to create something that is similar but with a different approach. I hope you enjoy it!

It also does not contain the same exact features. Right now, responsive screen sizes are not supported. I am not sure if I will add this feature or not. Extending is done a little differentlly.
